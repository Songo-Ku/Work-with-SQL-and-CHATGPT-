## Introduction
this should show I am able to work with different type of data and sql dialects with CHATGPT,

I generated structure of example simple db, then asked for generate easy and advance set of queries.
I also showed in file Analysist_chatgpt_task_set1.txt how I can describe sample data by text to chatbgpt, 
how I define question, describe problems, find soultions, ask for help, go through query and divide into steps
to better understand problem or query and how queries work on sample data in imagination before start
to use query on production data and kill DB. It also show I am familiar with DB in at least intermediate lvl
and in some idea, ways in advance. 

I worked with sql in last 4 years (mainly mysql also postgresql)




## Usage
Open tasks, open sql responses to each set. 

Additionally I pasted case and story to question number 6 from set1 and show problem solve with Chatgpt 
and generation sample data from only description to chagpt. It shows how effectively I can use AI agent
to solve real problems and USE SQL on a daily basis.
