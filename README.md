## Introduction
This show I am able to work with different type of data and sql dialects with CHATGPT.
One of most interesting thing what I realize during my work with chatgpt that you have to be sceptical and 
double check answers. 
his answers and make proper questions to evaluate he gave me correct answer or made mistake. I paste example 
when I had to struggle with chatgpt and mistakes in few answers in row. It shows that person who works with
Chatgpt need to have poper skills: analytical mind, problem solving also being consistent, knowledgeable
familiar with data and sql and overall problems or solutions.

Case with mistakes of chatgpt about generating examples and solution in file:
"exanoke_mistakes_of_chatgpt_and_my_evaluation.txt"

I generated structure of example simple db, then asked for generate easy and advance set of queries.
I also showed in file analysis_chatgpt_task7_set1.txt, analysis_chatgpt_task8_set1.txt  how I can describe sample data by text to chatbgpt, 
how I define question, describe problems, find soultions, ask for help, go through query and divide into steps
to better understand problem or query and how queries work on sample data in imagination before start
to use query on production data and kill DB. It also show I am familiar with DB in at least intermediate lvl
and in some idea, ways in advance. 

I worked with sql in last 4 years (mainly mysql also postgresql) and 
I had first contact in 2019 with this language




## Usage
Open tasks, open sql responses to each set. 

Additionally I pasted case and story to question number 6 from set1 and show problem solve with Chatgpt 
and generation sample data from only description to chagpt. It shows how effectively I can use AI agent
to solve real problems and USE SQL on a daily basis.
